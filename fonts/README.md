Place the Stardew Valley font file here (e.g. `StardewValley.ttf`).

Steps:
1. Copy the font file from your computer into this folder.
2. Make sure the filename is `StardewValley.ttf` (case-sensitive on some platforms).
3. Reload `index.html` — the page will detect and use the font for the SDV banner text if available.

If you don't have the font file, you can use the bundled fallback (Fredoka One) or request help for an alternative font.
